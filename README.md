ARRIA — Artificial Reconnaissance & Research Intelligence Agent

🔎 What ARRIA Is

ARRIA is a private R&D intelligence framework engineered to support:

Reconnaissance automation

Vulnerability discovery

Network-risk detection

Human-centric cyber-behavior mapping

Advanced threat-detection research

Modular security workflows for analysts & engineers


ARRIA is NOT a consumer AI product.
It is an internal intelligence system built for learning, experimentation, and private security research.

🛡️ kImo Safe Language (Official Positioning)

ARRIA is an internal research initiative of Azcendria Astral.
All modules, tools, and methodologies in this repository are:

Independently developed

Not based on external AI company IP

Not connected to third-party AI rights holders

Derived from operational cybersecurity models


ARRIA exists solely as an educational and experimental system.
